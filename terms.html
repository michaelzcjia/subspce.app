            Description of Service
          </b>
            <p class="paragraph secondary-color launchaco-builder-hoverable">
              The Service enables users to create their own subspaces on their browser. A subspace refers to a collection of browser windows and the tabs within those windows. The Service allows the users to create their own sessions with a date-timestamp for the start and end of it, and attach a subspace of their choosing to it. When the session starts, the collection of browser windows and tabs in the attached subspace will automatically open for the user.

              Subspce integrates with Google Calendar allowing the user to seamlessly create subspace sessions while scheduling events on Google Calendar.

Similarly, if a user creates a session in the Subspce extension, a corresponding event will be created on their Google Calendar. To provide this functionality, we request permissions to read, and write to the users Google Calendar. These privileges are used solely for the outlined functionality of the Service.         </div>
